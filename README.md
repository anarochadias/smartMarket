# SmartMarket
This project was made in collaboration with: [Ana](https://github.com/abeingadrift), [Filipa](https://github.com/filipafaraujo) and [Miguel](https://github.com/mikeecunha).

This project was made for a number of subjects in the upskill Power Platform course.

## Overview

SmartMarket was a project designed to revolutionize grocery shopping by introducing an innovative app. The primary objective of this app was to help users find the most competitive prices for their grocery items. Regrettably, due to time constraints, our team was unable to finish the app. Nevertheless, we successfully developed the foundational components including a database and some forms. These components allowed us to create, update, and delete various items within the database.
